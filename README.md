# RIQA
C-RIQA and QAC-Net
This repository contains a new dataset C-RIQA with continuous quality scores of retinal images, and our proposed new method QAC-Net for the qualitative and quantitative quality assessment of retinal images. The C-RIQA consists of 2,300 real-world retinal images. Each image in the C-RIQA dataset is annotated with a continuous quality score of 0-5 scale, by our conducted subjective experiment. In addition, we propose a new method based the idea of contrastive learning for qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the quality of retinal images. The data in C-RIQA and the code of QAC-Net are placed on https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BmgyHz5zeNVPoOVU7KUunA. If you would like to access it, please contact us by email zspbme@163.com to obtain the extraction code.
